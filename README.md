# ArtistsCollective-WorldMap

Created my first semester in Madison College's Web Software Developer program, 
this is a page from a website designed for independent artists. The idea was to 
build a site that artists could use to easily apply to the artists' collective, 
and to upload and sell their wares. Likewise, buyers should be able to easily  
search for, find, and buy beautiful art from artists the world over.

I coded this page with only basic CSS (first semester class, no advanced techniques).
 It's amazing what one can do with CSS and some creativity (and tenacity)! 

I created the visual design with an eye on artistic styling and simplicity while 
maintaining an ease of use with the art-buying customer in mind. I used a colorful, 
artistic image of the globe as a background. The colors from each continent are 
used in the associated text to visually link the text with the continent. 
I used semi-transparent background so that the world map would always be visible - 
a unifying and beautiful theme.

Note: the art itself is not mine. If this were a real website, the art would 
have been commissioned from one of the artists of the collective to help 
showcase the very _raison d'Ãªtre_ for the site.

I'm proud this website was voted "Best in Class" for design integrity, 
clear interface, and visual appeal.
